Each aircraft in the simulation have unique properties as defined in the aircraft.csv or in the running of the simulation (e.g. run.py, via a Python dictionary). Aircraft have:

- A time at which they are introduced to the simulation and evolve with the simulation
- An associated agent
- An associated and unique callsign
- An action--defined as "kind" and "subkind"--see action.md for more details. "kind" defines what type of action the flight will take within the simulation (increase/decrease flight_level, speed, heading, or bay) whilst "subkind" specifies whether this increase or decrease is done in a relative or absolute manner
- A value--associated with the action. E.g. if the action is specified as speed, this value is a new target speed for the aircraft

An aircraft in the simulation has the following associated values as it evolves through the simulation:
